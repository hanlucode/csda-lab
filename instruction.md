Assignment 1: Association Rule Mining or Recommender Systems

Assignment 2: Text Mining or Deep Learning

Assignment 3: Time Series Analysis or Social Network or Reinforcement Learning

Each group needs to submit two things for each assignment following the steps in the attached Ethical ML framework:

1) A report in the form of R Markdown or Python Notebook 

2) A shiny app or a Dash app

3) Git repo link with all the code and data

Write a report covering all the steps of the project and submit it along with the markdown. The results should be reproducible using your report. Please carefully describe every assumption and every step in your report.

Report Structure

After you have covered the business and data understanding sections where you reformulate a problem statement as an analytics problem, develop a proposed set of drivers and relationships to inputs, state the set of assumptions related to the problem, define key metrics of success and describe how you have applied the ethical ML framework (see attached), identify and prioritize means of data acquisition, you proceed with the following sections. 

Data Preparation

Describe the purpose of the data set you selected (i.e., why was this data collected in the first place?). Describe how you would define and measure the outcomes from the dataset. How would you measure the effectiveness of a good prediction algorithm in this case?
Define and prepare your target variables. Use proper variable representations (int, float, one-hot, etc.). Use pre-processing methods (as needed) for dimensionality reduction, scaling, etc. Remove variables that are not needed/useful for the analysis
Describe the final dataset that is used for classification (include a description of any newly formed variables you created).
Modeling and Evaluation

Describe the meaning and type of data (scale, values, etc.) for each attribute in the data file.
Verify data quality: Are there missing values? Duplicate data? Outliers? Are those mistakes? How do you deal with these problems?
Give simple, appropriate statistics (range, mode, mean, median, variance, counts, etc.) for the most important attributes and describe what they mean or if you found something interesting. Note: You can also use data from other sources for comparison.
Visualize the most important attributes appropriately (at least 5 attributes). Important: Provide an interpretation for each chart. Explain for each attribute why you chose the used visualization.
Explore relationships between attributes: Look at the attributes via scatter plots, correlation, cross-tabulation, group-wise averages, etc. as appropriate.
Identify and explain interesting relationships between features and the class you are trying to predict (or cluster).
Are there other features that could be added to the data or created from existing features?  Which ones?
Choose and explain your evaluation metrics that you will use (i.e., accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure, or a mix of all of them). Why are these appropriate for analyzing the results of your modeling?
Choose the method you will use for dividing your data into training and testing splits (i.e., are you using Stratified 10-fold cross validation? Why?). Explain why your chosen method is appropriate or use more than one method as appropriate.
Create three different  models. Adjust parameters as appropriate to increase generalization performance.
Which attributes from your analysis are most important? Use proper methods discussed in class to evaluate the importance of different attributes.
Analyze the results using your chosen method of evaluation. Use visualizations of the results to bolster the analysis.
Describe your results. What findings are the most interesting?
Discuss the advantages of each model for each task, if any. If there are not advantages, explain why. Is any model better than another? Is the difference significant with 95% confidence? Use proper statistical comparison methods
Deployment

How useful is your model for interested parties (i.e., the companies or organizations that might want to use it)?
How would you deploy your model for interested parties?
What other data should be collected?
How often would the model need to be updated, etc.?
Build a simple shiny app with a particular user group in mind to demonstrate how your model should be deployed in the industry
Please find attached a set of group submissions for Assignment 1, 2 and 3 that will serve as a sample for you. These submissions were grade A from a previous cohort group. Don't forget to use the Ethical ML framework.

Participation Grade

Princeton's Center for Information Technology Policy and Center for Human Values have created four anonymized case studies to promote the discussion of ethics. To underline the importance and to help you think seriously about data ethics in this course, I have posted these case studies under Discussions > Coffee Shop. 

To get full marks for the participation portion of your grade, I am asking each group to review the 4 case studies, reflect on each and address the questions raised in the case studies. The deadline for submission is the last onsite session. Since each group is composed of 4, each member of your group will work on one case study. I will leave to your group to divide the 4 case studies amongst you. The best way to submit your response is to reply to the thread for each case study directly under the Coffee Shop.

None of these issues are simple, and there are few (if any) "right answers." For example, it’s easy to react against perceived paternalism in a medical application, but the purpose of such an application is to encourage patients to comply with their treatment program. It’s easy to object to monitoring students in a public school, but students are minors, and schools by nature handle a lot of private personal data. Where is the boundary between what is, and isn’t, acceptable? What's important isn’t getting to the correct answer on any issue, but to make sure the issue is discussed and understood, and that we know what tradeoffs we are making. What is important is that we get practice in discussing ethical issues and put that practice to work in our jobs. That’s what these case studies give us.

Looking forward to your perspectives.
